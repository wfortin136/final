== README

Currently, I have implemented "fights" as the full RESTful resource. It
is tightly integrated with the other resources, so for now I attempted to i
implement those other sources at a minimum, to support fights. While I have not
gone through full testing with all variations of how the fights resource will 
interact with other resources, preliminary tests show the full set of RESTful
commands are working properly. As an example, populating a scorecard for a new
fight is not included yet. Also, there are no protections on the input fields.
Leaving some fields blank or putting improper data can still cause an error.

Additionally, there are seeds.rb and models.yml files. For now, the seeds.rb
file has data manually entered for initial testing. There is an additional
parse file that I have started to create in order to scrape an external webpage
for data, that will get populated into the db.

And finally, while some very initial CSS formatting has been used, the front-end
has not been implemented. So visual formatting is far from the end state.

Below are the details of environment
